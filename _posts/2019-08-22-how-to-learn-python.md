This post relays important points, well articulated by [The
TechLead](the-techlead-how-to-learn-python-tutorial), about how to
learn python. The [main
takeaway](main-takeaway) is this:  
> "Why are you watching this video when there is a complete python
> tutorial on the official python website?"

# Why is this so relevant?  
Because of dilution of information: there is so much information
available on the internet, and so much of it is replicated, that it
often becomes difficult to find anything relevant.  

# From tutorial to documentation  
To a significant though lesser extent, this is true of python's
documentation: it is worth consulting it first and visiting other
tutorials only in the case where that was not enough.  
Incidentally, one's ability to rely solely on a language's
documentation is a good measure of one's progress in learning to
program.


# Does this extend to other languages?  
The [second takeaway](language-author-best-interest) is this:
> "Generally it's going to be in every language author's best interest
to make sure their language is used by as many people as they can."  

I find that this is certainly true of python, and as a rule it is
worth trying this assumption to any other language, and more generally
to any module or package.
