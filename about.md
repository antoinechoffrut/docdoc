I am a mathematician with over a decade of experience in academic
research, where my specialization was in the analysis of partial
differential equations, and I am now transitioning to the field of
data science.

# About the content
Most of the posts will be quick reference notes for my own convenience
on things that I do repeatedly but regularly end up having to look up
in scattered places.  The topics will probably more often cover tools
that I discover make working with a computer significantly more fluid,
rather than on data science itself.


# About the name

[FastAI][fastai-docs] is a Deep Learning library.  It is extremely
well documented and the documentation of every function can be
accessed with the function [`doc`][fastai-doc-documentation].  But
`doc` being a function itself, its own documentation can be
accessed via itself, i.e. with `doc(doc)`.  

I think this fun fact touches at the core of computing and that it is
fitting to use it for the name of a page where I document some of my
learning in computing.  

# About the theme

I am using [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to create this website, 
and the theme is [minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima).
